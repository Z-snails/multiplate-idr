# Multiplate

Multiplate is a library for writing traversals over mutually recursive data types.

This is largely a port of the [Haskell version](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/multiplate), and the Haskell [Multiplate Simplified](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/multiplate-simplified) packages.
